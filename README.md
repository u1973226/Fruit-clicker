# Fruit-clicker
Fruit clicker game where you have to click the fruit before it touches the ground. Watch out for poison!

We have:
Froot!!
Poison!!

Froot gives one point, but keep your eyes open because some golden froot may drop! This froot gives 3 points instead of 1!!

Poison modes!! Poison ends the game by default. But if you writte "-1 points" on the initial prompt, you'll get a game mode in which poison rests a point instead of causing a game over!!
